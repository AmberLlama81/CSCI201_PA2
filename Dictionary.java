 *
 * Implementation of an Amortized Array-Based Dictionary data structure.
 *
 * This data structure supports duplicates and does *NOT* support storage of
 * null references.
 *
 * Notes:
 * 		-It is *highly* recommended that you begin by reading over all the methods,
 *       all the comments, and all the code that has already been written for you.
 *
 * 		-the specifications provided are to help you understand what the methods
 *       are supposed to accomplish.
 * 		-they are *NOT* descriptions for how you should implement the methods.
 * 		-See the lab documentation & lecture notes for implementation details.
 *
 * 		-Some of the helper methods specify a runtime cost; make sure your
 *       implementation meets that requirement.
 * 		-(Also, obviously, if the lecture notes and/or the lab documentation specifies
 *       a runtime cost for a method, you need to pay attention to that).
